Human Leukocyte Antigens (HLAs) are proteins that attach to the membranes of cells to help the immune system 
identify which cells are "self" cells and which are "invader" cells. Each person has a collection of different HLAs,
and the more HLAs that are shared between the donor and the recipient the safer a kidney transplant will be. 
The similarity is measured by a "HLA match score". 

When someone wishes to donate a kidney, there are two main ways they can donate. They can give a “directed donation”, 
meaning they wish to donate to a specific person. They could also give a “non-directed donation”, meaning they choose to 
donate without knowing the recipient. Because of all the factors at play for donor-recipient compatibility, it may be the 
case that a recipient does not know anyone who would be a matching directed donor. To help patients to donors, donation 
networks have been set up. The idea is that if Recipient A needs a kidney, but their friend Donor A is not compatible, 
then perhaps Donor A could give a kidney to compatible Recipient B in exchange for Donor B giving a kidney to Recipient A. 
So in short, if Recipient A has no known donors, they can try to identify a "kidney trade" with another recipient using one 
of their directed donors. These trades could also be larger "kidney donation cycles", where Donor A gives to Recipient B, 
Donor B gives to recipient C, and Donor C gives to recipient A.

We allow cycle matches to occur if the HLA score is above 60 and can also find if cycles with desired recipients exist
and return them.
